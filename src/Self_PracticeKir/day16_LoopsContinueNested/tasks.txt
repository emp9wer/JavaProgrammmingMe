                         2. Display the grade of the student.
                                        90 ~ 100 ==> A
                                        80 ~ 89 ==> B
                                        70 ~ 79 ==> C
                                        60 ~ 69 ==> D
                                        0 ~ 59 ==> F

                        2. Ask the user would you like to continue

                                If "no" --> print "Thank you for using Cydeo Grade Calculator APP"

                                If user enters an invalid entry, terminate the program after displaying the error message "Invalid Entry"


                         Hint: you can use  System.exit(1) to terminate the entire program


7. Write a program that can find the frequency of the characters from a string

                         Ex:
                        str = "aabcccd";

                        output:
                                a2b1c3d1


            Hint: if you find out how to find the frequency of one character, then repeat it for all the remaining characters
