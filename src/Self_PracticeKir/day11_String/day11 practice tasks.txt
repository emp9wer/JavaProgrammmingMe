6. Create a class calledEmailTask1. 
   Assume that email address is constructed by person's first name and followed by an underscore and last name.

    Write a program that can swap first name with last name in the email (Separated by an underscore).
    If the email doesn't contain an underscore print the given input email.

                Last name: Federighi
                Domain: apple

8. Create a class called TipCalculator, and write a program for a tip calculator. 
    There will be different service quality benchmarks that will determine the tip given. 
    There will also the ability to calculate based on the number of people in the party and if there is a split of the bill or not.
        
        Poor = 5%, Fair = 10%, Good = 15%, Great = 20%, Excellent = 25%

    The program should ask the user to enter:
            - Split or No split (Yes or No), 
             - Enter the number of people (number)
             - Enter the check amount (number) 
             - Service Quality (String) 

    And then it should display:
             Number of people entered
             Total to pay
             Total tip
             Total per person
             Tip per person:

        Ex: 
            Split or No split (Yes or No)?

            476
            How was the service quality? (Excellent/Great/Good/Fair/Poor)
            ExCElLeNt

            output:
                Number of people entered: 4
                Total to pay: 595.0
                Total tip: 119.0
                Total per person: 148.75
                Tip per person: 29.75
